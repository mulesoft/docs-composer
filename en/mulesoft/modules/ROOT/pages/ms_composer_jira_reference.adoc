= Jira Connector Reference

Jira is a powerful project management tool and ticketing system used to help users plan, track, release, and report product issues in order to improve development.

To use Jira Connector with Composer, you must have the _Administrator Jira_ global permission. For more information, see the https://support.atlassian.com/jira-work-management/docs/manage-permissions/[Jira documentation^].

== Connections

include::_partials/connection-name.adoc[]

Organization Site URL::

Enter the URL of the Jira organization containing the sandbox or production environment to which you want to connect. If you do not specify a value in the *Organization Site URL* field, the connection uses the first URL listed in the `/resources` endpoint of the Atlassian API. Set the *Organization Site URL* field for every connection if you want the connection to use a specific organization instead of a default organization. For more information about Jira organizations, see the https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/get-started-with-an-atlassian-organization/[Jira documentation^].

To connect to a Jira organization via an Atlassian account: 

. In the *Connect to your Jira Account* window, in the *Organization Site URL* field, enter the Jira organization URL. For example, `+https://orgname.atlassian.net+`.  
. Click *Connect*. +
An Atlassian window appears, indicating that Composer is requesting access to an Atlassian account. 
. In the window, in the *Authorize for site* dropdown, select the organization you want to use and then click *Accept*. +
Composer is now connected to your Jira organization.
