= Stripe Connector Reference

Online payment processing platforms, like Stripe, are used by a growing number of businesses. Stripe enables businesses of all sizes to process payments through APIs by keeping customers and payment information synched.

== Connections

include::_partials/connection-definition.adoc[]

include::_partials/connection-name.adoc[]

API key::

The value in this field maps to the `Authorization` field in the specialist connector and functions as a username in Stripe. Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Authentication. Your API key is your username and a password is not required. You can find your API key in your https://stripe.com/docs/api/authentication[Stripe Dashboard]. The Stripe API:

* Uses API keys to authenticate requests.
* Supplies test mode keys that have the prefix `sk_test_` and live mode secret keys that have the prefix `sk_live_`.
* Allows users to use restricted API keys for granular permissions.
* Ensures that all API requests are made via HTTPS.

https://stripe.com/docs/connect/oauth-reference[Stripe Connect] supports OAuth authentication, but Stripe does not. For more information on OAuth authentication in Stripe, see https://www.similartech.com/compare/stripe-vs-stripe-connect.

== Triggers

include::_partials/trigger-definition.adoc[]

New charge::

Checks for a new charge to a payment source.

New refund::

Executes when a new refund is created.

== Actions

include::_partials/action-definition.adoc[]

Create charge::

Create a new charge. When creating a new charge, note that:

* In the `Amount` field, the value is an integer. For instance, 1.00 is 100.
* The following fields require values:
** Either the `Source` or the `Customer` field
** `Customer ID` +
Note that best practice dictates that the value in the Customer ID field should come from an existing account in Stripe. For example, `cus_JQ1BWAcXfKuswb`.
** Some shipping fields are required if any shipping fields are present.

+

For more information on the *Create Charge* action in Stripe, see https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/create.
