= Build Composer Flows

After you have collected the information as described in the Composer Checklist, build and test your flow:

. Create a trigger and test it.
. Create each action in order. Test each action before adding another.

Once these steps are complete, you're ready to activate the flow and then monitor your flow.

After you've tested the complete flow, you're ready to activate.
