= Monitor a Composer Flow

After activation, you can monitor active Composer flows.

. In the Composer home page, click *Composer Flows*.
. In the *All* view, click the name of a flow to display the Flow Detail page.

The Flow Detail page shows the flow's run history: each time the flow runs, and whether that run was successful:
