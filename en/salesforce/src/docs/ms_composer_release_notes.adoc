//CAPP-1550
+
** If you want to change the data source, for example switching from Salesforce to Workday, create a new flow.
** If you want to change the instance of the same data source, but the connection for that source doesn't exist yet:
+
. Add an action to the end of your flow. In the action, create the connection you need.
. Delete the action.
. Open the trigger and use *Change Connection* to change to the new connection.
