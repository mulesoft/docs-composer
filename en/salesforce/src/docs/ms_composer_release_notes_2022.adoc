= Release Notes for MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce - 2022

Use MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce to build connected experiences faster. You don't need to wait for development resources to unlock data, integrate apps, and automate business processes that create real customer value.

New versions are automatically available once they are released; you don't need to perform any tasks to move to the new version.

//* Fixed the issue in Workday Connector in which the the *Create Worker* action returned a value for *Applicant Reference ID* but not for *Employee Reference*.
//| Fixed an issue in NetSuite Connector in which creating custom fields on the *Contact* object with the type `document` did not return results. | COCN-752
//| Fixed an issue in NetSuite Connector in which nested fields containing the `list` type failed. | COCN-726
//* Composer now supports the static creation of lists. You can now dynamically complete fields that are enabled for lists even if those fields do not have an existing list to map to in the flow.

== July 29, 2022

* You can now connect a new system: HubSpot.
+

See xref:ms_composer_reference.adoc[the product documentation] for details about each connector.

* Required fields in Composer are now denoted with an asterisk (*). Previously, when adding fields in Composer, only optional fields appeared in the modals. Now:

 ** When a parent field is selected or deselected and it has required child fields, those child fields are also selected or deselected by default.
 ** When a field is selected or deselected and it has required parent fields, those parent fields are also selected or deselected by default.
 ** When an optional field is selected, the corresponding required fields (including one or more parent fields) are also selected.
 +
Required fields can be removed only by deselecting them within the modal.

* HTTP Connector now supports Paginated Requests. When retrieving collections of objects from remote systems, use Paginated Requests to ensure that all data pages are returned.

* Flows based on a scheduler now have access to the scheduler's current and previous timestamps.

* When deleting a connection, a list of active and inactive flows using the selected connection now appears. Using this list, if the connection is:
** Not used in any flows, you can delete the connection.
** Used in inactive flows, a list containing the name and count of inactive flows using this connection appears. Deleting this connection will affect the listed flows. If you reopen the inactive flow, you must select a new connection.
** Used in active and inactive flows, a list containing the name, count, and status of active and inactive flows using this connection appears. If you choose to delete the connection, secondary confirmation appears. Prior to deleting the connection, Composer will first attempt to stop the flows.
