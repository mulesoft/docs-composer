= Troubleshooting MuleSoft Composer

I can't find MuleSoft Composer in my Salesforce org:: You need to purchase MuleSoft Composer as an add-on product for your Salesforce org,
and you need to be an administrator to configure it. If you have the correct permissions, but don't see it in the App Launcher, it's likely you haven't purchased it.
If you know it is installed in your org, verify that you have the permission set *Composer User*.

Why doesn't the sample output match my test record?:: Sample output is taken from a record in the system you connect to, not the record you create during a test.
You won't change any data until you activate the flow. Use the sample data to verify that the flow you are building does what you expect.

Where do I create new connections?::

Create or edit a flow to have access to the dialog where you create a new connection. The dialog is available for the trigger and actions in your flow.
