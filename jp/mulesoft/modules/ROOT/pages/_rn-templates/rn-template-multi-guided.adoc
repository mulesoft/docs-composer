Use this template for RNs with multiple releases (major.x, major.minor.x) per file.

For new RN files:

. Copy this .adoc to your product folder and rename.
. Complete the sections, leaving the includes for the headings.
. Delete guidance and any headings that don't apply.

For existing RN files:

. Copy the content of this .adoc to your existing RN file.
. Complete the sections, leaving the includes for the headings.
. Delete guidance and any headings that don't apply.
. Don't change the format for previous releases.

* Release Notes must include at least one of What’s New or Fixed Issues.
+
For example, new releases have no fixed issues; patch releases often contain bug fixes only.
+
* If a section does not apply, *delete it*.
+
For example, if a release contains no fixed issues or compatibility doesn’t apply.
* Titles are always plural, regardless of the number of notes under the title.
+
* Use the includes to keep titles consistent.*
* For bulleted lists:
+
--
** Always use bullets - even if there is only one!
** Always add a period - even for incomplete sentences!
--
* List items in order of importance, if known.
* Release Notes follow the same authoring and approval process as other documentation.
* If Release Notes include links to new or changed feature documentation, make sure to merge those changes before merging the RN PR.

*<ReleaseDate>*​

////

If a product is released in the EU before in the US, the date is the EU release date.
Use this format:

* Most releases: April 22, 2021

The What’s New section can include (in this order):

. Features
+
Feature, action, or workflow that did not exist in any form in previous releases of the product.
. Enhancements

Upgrade or improvement to an existing feature, including security and operating system updates - not bug fixes.
. Changes
+
Features or behaviors that changed from previous versions.
. Deprecations
. Bundled Components

Guidelines for What’s New:

* If the release includes many changes, add subsections to organize the content into the types.

include::partial$release-notes/rn-headings.adoc[tag=knownIssues,leveloffset=+3]

////
(Delete if no known issues. Remove the Workaround column if not needed.)

The Known Issues section includes issues that can disrupt the normal workflow for many users and that they should know before upgrading. A known issue must include one of these criteria:

* Bug found too late to fix for the current release that developers intend to fix in a later release
* Bug that has a workaround

Most release notes do not include known issues. If you include a known issue, you must track it so that you can continue to list it as a known issue until it is fixed.

IMPORTANT: Always get PM approval before listing a known issue and ensure that the issue meets the Known Issues criteria. Do not include limitations in Known Issues. Instead, document limitations in the product documentation.

Guidelines for Known Issues:

* Present known issues (and workarounds, if applicable) in a table, and the ticket number in the last column.
* Describe the known issue in terms of how the user might experience it.
+
For example:
+
[%header,cols="2,2,1", width="75”]
|===
|Known Issue|Workaround |ID
|An error occurs when saving a new host profile. | Refresh the page. |SE-4242
|X12 EDI Connector supports files up to 20MB. See xref:repo::adoc[]| |
|===
+
* Copy any unfixed known issues from the previous release to the current release.
* When a known issue from a previous release is fixed, add it to Fixed Issues and identify it as a previously known issue.
+
If the fix is a new feature, add it to What’s New.
////

include::partial$release-notes/rn-headings.adoc[tag=upgrade,leveloffset=+3]

////
(Delete if not applicable)

The Upgrade section includes any information a user needs to know before and immediately after upgrading
(such as hardware, software, and workspace upgrade requirements).

Guidelines for Upgrade:

* Include a link to an upgrade or migrate topic/section in the product release notes.
+
If you link to the product doc, make sure to merge any product doc changes before merging the RN PR.
+
* Don’t include upgrade details, such as the steps for upgrading or tables of differences between two releases, in the release notes.
* Instead, add them to an Upgrade topic in the main documentation and link to that topic from the RNs.
