= Release Notes for MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce - 2022

Use MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce to build connected experiences faster. You don't need to wait for development resources to unlock data, integrate apps, and automate business processes that create real customer value.

New versions are automatically available once they are released; you don't need to perform any tasks to move to the new version.

//* Fixed the issue in Workday Connector in which the *Create Worker* action returned a value for *Applicant Reference ID* but not for *Employee Reference*.
//| Fixed an issue in NetSuite Connector in which creating custom fields on the *Contact* object with the type `document` did not return results. | COCN-752
//| Fixed an issue in NetSuite Connector in which nested fields containing the `list` type failed. | COCN-726
//* Composer now supports the static creation of lists. You can now dynamically complete fields that are enabled for lists even if those fields do not have an existing list to map to in the flow.

See xref:ms_composer_release_notes_ki.adoc[Known Issues and Limitations for MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce] for a list of known issues and limitations by date.

Templates are patterns that you can leverage to build a flow. All of the steps and field mappings are predefined, so you can select the template and enter the missing information for the various connectors used (such as connection secrets) to create a flow you can later customize. Since templates are pre-built flows, templates not only reduce the barrier to entry and accelerate the time to activate the flow, but also include the best practices for flows.

For example, when keeping files in sync between Salesforce instances, you can download binary file content from one instance and later upload that same file content to another instance using the new *Download file* and *Upload file* actions.

* To facilitate MuleSoft Automation, the subscription pricing method has been reevaluated for MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce. To enable this enhancement, a new tab, *Usage Summary*, has been added to the MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce landing page. On the *Usage Summary* tab, you can view your monthly tasks and credit usage per flow for your organization.
