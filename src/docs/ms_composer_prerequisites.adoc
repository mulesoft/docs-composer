= MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce Prerequisites

You must have the correct Salesforce edition and have access to MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce (Composer) in your Salesforce org.
Additionally, an admin must set up Composer for use and assign the Composer permission to users.

== Meet Salesforce Org Requirements

* Use a Salesforce Unlimited, Enterprise, or Performance edition.
* Enable Lightning.
* Purchase the separate MuleSoft Composer license.

== Set Up Composer

Before anyone can use Composer, a Salesforce admin must set up Composer:

. Log in to your Salesforce org as an admin.
. Click the Setup gear icon and choose *Setup*.
. Enter `composer` in the search bar.
. Select *MuleSoft Composer* from the search results.
. From the *Get Started* page, complete all the tasks listed.

== Verify Access to Composer

If you aren't the Salesforce admin who installed Composer, verify that you have access to the Composer app:

. In your Salesforce org, open the App Launcher.
. Enter `composer` in the search bar.
. Select *MuleSoft Composer* from the search results.
+
If you don't see *MuleSoft Composer* in the search results,
it's likely that you need to purchase Composer for your Salesforce org or that you don't have permission to access it.

When the Composer page displays, you're ready to create your first flow.
