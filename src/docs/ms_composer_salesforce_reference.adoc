= Salesforce Reference

Whether you are using Salesforce as a data source (take new Salesforce records and copy them to a Google Sheet, for example) or a data target (take a Google Sheet row and turn it into a Salesforce lead), some details of how to work with data in a flow are specific to the data source or data target.

== Connections

include::_partials/connection-definition.adoc[]

include::_partials/connection-name.adoc[]

Username and password::

The username and password that you used to log in to Salesforce.
You'll need to create a connection even if the data source is the same Salesforce org
where you operate Composer.
However, Composer won't ask for your password again. Instead, it displays an authentication approval dialog.

URL::

The URL that you used to log in to Salesforce, for example, `myOrg.salesforce.com`.

=== Salesforce Connected App Limits

Salesforce allows each user to grant access to no more than five connected apps at a time.
Because of this limit, if you create more than five Composer connections to the same Salesforce org, Salesforce
revokes tokens from the oldest to the most recently created, without notice, until the number of authorized tokens returns to five.

If possible, create only one connection per user per Salesforce org to avoid this issue.

For more about Salesforce connected apps and authorization, see https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_request_manage.htm.

=== Relaxed IP Restrictions

If your org has IP restrictions set, errors that reference IP or OAuth failures may occur. Relax the IP restrictions to resolve this error.

To relax IP restrictions on a connection to Salesforce:

. Log into the Salesforce org. You must be a Salesforce admin in that org.
. Navigate to *Setup > Connected Apps OAuth Usage*.
. Find *MuleSoft Composer* in the list, and click *Install*.
. Click *Install* on the authorization dialog.
+
This makes the connected app (the connection you created) available so that you can relax the IP restrictions. It doesn't reinstall the Composer app.
. Click *Edit Policies*.
. Change IP Relaxation to *Relax IP Restrictions* and then save your change.

IP restrictions are now relaxed for the connection.

=== Change a Connection

To change a connection:

. Open the flow.
. Click the change icon in the trigger or every action that connects to a sandbox:
+

. Choose a new connection and save your changes.

=== Salesforce Sandbox and Production Orgs

You can connect to Salesforce sandbox and production orgs.

To protect your production org:

. Connect to a sandbox org when you build and test a flow.
. After testing is complete, connect to a production org, test the flow with the new connection, and then activate the flow.
+
Remember to change the connection from sandbox to production in every trigger and action that uses the sandbox connection.

== Triggers

include::_partials/trigger-definition.adoc[]

New record::

Checks for a new record every 10 minutes.

New or updated record::

Checks for new or updated records of the specified object type every 10 minutes.

Deleted record::

Checks for soft-deleted records. Soft-deleted records are stored in Salesforce for approximately 15 days.
+
Records are typically stored for approximately 15 days before being hard-deleted and irretrievable.
* You can't modify the soft-delete timestamp.

== Actions

include::_partials/action-definition.adoc[]

Create new record::

Create a standard or custom record.

Update record::

Update any standard or custom record as specified by an external ID.

Get records::

Return all the records that match specified search terms.

Create or update record::

Update any standard or custom record as specified by record ID.
If the record ID isn't found, create the record.

Delete record::

Delete a record specified by its object type and record ID.

== Objects

All standard and custom Salesforce objects are available.

Some products in Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud use data that is not stored in Salesforce records and therefore is not available with a Salesforce connection.
