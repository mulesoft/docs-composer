= NetSuite Connector Reference

Whether you are using NetSuite as a data source (take a new NetSuite contact and copy it to Salesforce, for example) or a data target (when a Salesforce opportunity closes, create a NetSuite sales order), the details of how to work with data in a flow are specific to the data source or data target.

== Connection Details

When connecting to NetSuite via MuleSoft Composer, in NetSuite:

* Ensure that token-based authentication is enabled by navigating to *Setup* > *Integration Management* > *Manage Integration* > *Authentication*.
* Ensure that the role used in the integration is not using two-factor authentication by navigating to *Setup* > *User/Roles* > *Two-Factor Authentication Roles*.

//* *Account ID*: The *Account ID* value associated with your NetSuite instance. You can view the account ID by navigating to *Setup* > *Integration* > *SOAP Web Services Preferences*.
//* *Consumer Key*: The *Consumer Key* value generated in NetSuite. You can generate a value for consumer key by navigating to *Setup* > *Integration* > *Manage Integrations*.

=== Establish a NetSuite Connection

To use MuleSoft Composer to establish a NetSuite connection, you must have:

* The MuleSoft Composer User permission set to `perform integration tasks`.

* An account in Salesforce to store the internal ID of the associated customer in NetSuite. You must ensure that a custom field, NetSuite ID, has been created for the Account object in the organization.
