= Build and Test a Composer Flow

After you have collected the information as described in xref:ms_composer_checklist.adoc[the preparation checklist], build and test your flow:

. Create and name a flow.
. In the flow, create a trigger and test it.
. In the flow, create each action in order. Test each action before adding the next.

After these steps are complete, you're ready to activate the flow, and then monitor it.

. Click *Add new connection* and then add the username, password, and URL where you usually type in these credentials. Some systems require different types of information, so be sure to check the reference topic for the system you want to connect.

=== Add an Existing Connection

To select an existing connection, open or start a flow, and then choose *Add new connection*.

=== Change a Connection Name

To change the name of an existing connection that isn't in a deployed flow, choose *Manage*.

=== Change a Connection

You can change connections in any trigger or action. For example, you can create a flow using connections to a Salesforce sandbox org, and then after your flow testing is complete, you can change the connection in your trigger and actions to use a production org.

To change a connection:

. Open the flow.
. Click the change icon in the trigger or action that connects to a sandbox:

== Create and Test an Action

steps

After you've tested the complete flow, you're ready to activate.

[NOTE]
If you used connections to sandbox orgs while creating the flow, don't forget to change the connections to production orgs and retest before activating.
