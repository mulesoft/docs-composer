= Scheduling, Polling, or Innvoking a Flow 

When managing how your flow operates, you can:

* <<schedule-a-flow,Schedule a flow>>.
* <<poll-a-flow,Poll a flow>>.
* <<invoke-a-flow,Invoke a flow>>.

Additionally, all users can <<open-access-for-flows,view or manage all flows within your org.>>

[[schedule-a-flow]]
== Schedule a Flow

If you don't choose a connection, you can schedule a flow to start at regular intervals.

To create a flow control:

. In a new flow, from the *What Should Start This Flow?* dialog, look in the Flow Control section and click *Scheduler*. 
. Select a time interval, from 15 minutes to 30 days. For intervals of a day or more, the scheduler might not run at the same time within each interval.

. Click *Save*. +
After creating the trigger, add one or more actions to the flow. To apply logic to an action, prepend it with an xref:ms_composer_using_actions_in_a_flow.adoc#create-an-if-else-block[If/Else block] or xref:ms_composer_using_actions_in_a_flow.adoc#create-and-test-a-for-each-loop[For Each loop].

[[poll-a-flow]]
== Poll a Flow 

This feature enables Composer to check the status of a flow for changes every 10 minutes. After polling the flow, the polling trigger starts processing changes. This functionality is useful for retrieving results that take a long time to finish and are not suitable for synchronous consumption. 

[[invoke-a-flow]]
== Invoke a Flow 

You can invoke a Composer flow from external systems, such as Flow Builder, Flow Orchestration, another Composer flow, an Apex callout, or a cURL command, to enable deeper interoperability and integrated capabilities across Salesforce. For more information, refer to xref:ms_composer_invocable_flows.adoc[Invoke a Composer Flow].

[[open-access-for-flows]]
== Open Access for Flows

All users can view or manage all flows within your org.

This feature is enabled by default for new customers and disabled by default for existing customers. To disable this feature at the org level, contact Composer Support.

=== Limitations

* To filter by owner of the flow, you must use the *Flow Owner* field and not the *Owner* field.
* When filtering using the *Flow Owner* field, you can use only the *starts with*, *equals*, and *contains* operators. The *starts with*, *equals*, and *contains* operators all mimic the functionality of the *contains* operator.
* In orgs of existing customers, *Flow Owner* is not visible by default in the list view on the *Composer Flows* tab. New customers, however, can see *Flow Owner* by default in the list view on the *Composer Flows* tab.

** To add *Flow Owner* to the *Recently viewed* list:

. From the *Composer Flows* tab, select *Recently viewed*.
. Go to *Setup > Search Layouts > Composer Flow > Default Layout*.
. Add *Flow Owner*.

** To add *Flow Owner* to *All* (or any other view list):

. From the *Composer Flows* tab, select *All*.
. Go to *List View Controls > Select Fields to Display*.
. Move *Flow Owner* from *Available Fields* to *Visible Fields*.
+
* Bulk ownership transfer or changing ownership to a user other than yourself is not supported.

=== View Flows

You can view all flows within your org and view flow details, such as the status to see if a flow is active or inactive, the last modified date to see flow changes (not activation or deactivation), the flow owner, or the run history.

To view all flows within your org:

. Go to the *Composer Flows* tab. You can now view all flows within your org and view flow details, such as *Flow Name*, *Status*, and *Last Modified Date*.

=== Manage Flows

You can manage all flows within your org. You can activate or deactivate all flows within your org, delete all flows within your org, edit all flows within your org, or change ownership of error email notification flows within your org.

To manage all flows within your org:

. From the *Composer Flows* tab, select a flow.
. Click on the desired button, for example, click *Delete* to delete a flow or click *Transfer ownership* to change flow ownership (for error email notification flows only).

When automating complex processes, be aware that flows with many steps can encounter numerous issues. To enhance automation efficiency, promote reusability, and ensure clarity for the entire organization, we recommend breaking down the process into logical sub-flows and invoking these sub-flows from a parent flow. As a best practice, when logical sub-flows are feasible, xref:ms_composer_invocable_flows.adoc#invoke-a-composer-flow-from-another-composer-flow[invoke a Composer flow from another Composer flow] to create and integrate sub-flows.
