= Release Notes for MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce

Use MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce to build connected experiences faster. You don't need to wait for development resources to unlock data, integrate apps, and automate business processes that create real customer value.

New versions are automatically available once they are released; you don't need to perform any tasks to move to the new version.

//* Fixed the issue in the Workday Connector in which the the *Create Worker* action returned a value for *Applicant Reference ID* but not for *Employee Reference*.
//| Fixed an issue in the NetSuite Connector in which creating custom fields on the *Contact* object with the type `document` did not return results. | COCN-752
//| Fixed an issue in the NetSuite Connector in which nested fields containing the `list` type failed. | COCN-726
//* Composer now supports the static creation of lists. You can now dynamically complete fields that are enabled for lists even if those fields do not have an existing list to map to in the flow.

** If you want to change the data source, for example switching from Salesforce to Workday, create a new flow.
** If you want to change the instance of the same data source, but the connection for that source doesn't exist yet:
+
. Add an action to the end of your flow. In the action, create the connection you need.
. Delete the action.
. Open the trigger and use *Change Connection* to change to the new connection.
