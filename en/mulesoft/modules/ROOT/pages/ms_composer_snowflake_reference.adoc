= Snowflake Connector Reference

Snowflake is a fully managed, cloud-based data warehouse solution that operates under a Software as a Service (SaaS) business model. This allows clients to store data and run analytics without the need for an on-premise solution.

For more information about privileges for triggers and actions, refer to https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview[Overview of Access Control^].

== Connections

include::_partials/connection-definition.adoc[]

Connection Name::

Enter a connection name that will help you remember the details of this connection.
You can reuse connections multiple times in a single flow, and in more than one flow,
and the credentials are hidden after you create the connection. Therefore, it's helpful
to provide a name that easily identifies this connection from others.
+
Only you can see the connection. Other users in your Composer app must create their own connections.

Username and password::

The username and password that you used to log in to Snowflake.

Account Name::

The account name that is provided when registering for the Snowflake account. The account name is in the `<OrgId>-<AccountId>` format. 

Warehouse::

The name of the Snowflake warehouse to use.

Database::

The Snowflake database to which you want to connect.

Schema::

The Snowflake database schema to use.

== Triggers

include::_partials/trigger-definition.adoc[]

On New Row::

Returns all new rows of a table based on the highest watermark value every 15 seconds. 
+
If the watermark value of a new row is lower than the highest watermark value, the new row is discarded. If the watermark value of a new row is higher than the highest watermark value, the new row is picked up and the watermark is set to the new highest value. 
+
If the flow is deactivated and reactivated manually, the watermark resets to the start time of the flow. If a start time is not specified in the flow, Composer uses the time the flow is activated as the timestamp.
+
Provide a value for the following fields:

* *Table*: Note that this trigger supports views within the *Table* field.
* *Created date column*: The following column data types are available for this field:
** DATE
** DATETIME
** TIMESTAMP
** TIMESTAMP_NTZ

On New Or Updated Row::

Returns all new or updated rows of a table based on the highest watermark value between *Created date column* and *Last modified date column* every 15 seconds. 
+
If the watermark value of a new or updated row is lower than the highest watermark value, the new or updated row is discarded. If the watermark value of a new or updated row is higher than the highest watermark value, the new or updated row is picked up and the watermark is set to the new highest value. 
+
If the flow is deactivated and reactivated manually, the watermark resets to the start time of the flow. If a start time is not specified in the flow, Composer uses the time the flow is activated as the timestamp.
+
Provide a value for the following fields:

* *Table*: Note that this trigger supports views within the *Table* field.
* *Created date column*: The following column data types are available for this field:
