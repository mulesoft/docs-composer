= NetSuite Connector Reference

Whether you are using NetSuite as a data source (take a new NetSuite contact and copy it to Salesforce, for example) or a data target (when a Salesforce opportunity closes, create a NetSuite sales order), the details of how to work with data in a flow are specific to the data source or data target.

== Connection Details

When connecting to NetSuite via MuleSoft Composer, in NetSuite:

* Ensure that token-based authentication is enabled by navigating to *Setup* > *Integration Management* > *Manage Integration* > *Authentication*.
* Ensure that the role used in the integration is not using two-factor authentication by navigating to *Setup* > *User/Roles* > *Two-Factor Authentication Roles*.

Composer supports NetSuite instances of 2020.2 and later.

+
You must connect to NetSuite as a regular user (WSU), not a concurrent user (cWSU).

include::_partials/netsuite-connection-details.adoc[]

//When creating a connection, note the following connection fields in NetSuite:

//* *Account ID*: The *Account ID* value associated with your NetSuite instance. You can view the account ID by navigating to *Setup* > *Integration* > *SOAP Web Services Preferences*.
//* *Consumer Key*: The *Consumer Key* value generated in NetSuite. You can generate a value for consumer key by navigating to *Setup* > *Integration* > *Manage Integrations*.
//* *Consumer Secret*: The *Consumer Secret* value generated in NetSuite. This value is generated when generating a value for *Consumer Key*.
//* *Token ID*: The *Token ID* value generated in NetSuite.
//* *Token Secret*: The *Token Secret* value generated with the token ID in NetSuite.

=== Establish a NetSuite Connection

To use MuleSoft Composer to establish a NetSuite connection, you must have an account in Salesforce to store the internal ID of the associated customer in NetSuite. You must ensure that a custom field, *NetSuite ID*, has been created for the Account object in the organization.

=== Set NetSuite Permissions

Access to NetSuite data and to the NetSuite user interface is based on users, roles, and permissions.

For more information about users, roles, and permissions, see the https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_N284861.html[NetSuite documentation].

MuleSoft provides a bundle that contains a role with the permissions required for integrating Composer with NetSuite. To install the bundle, follow these steps:

. Go to *Customization > SuiteBundler > Search & Install Bundles*.
. Type `462515` in the keyword search.
. Click on *MuleSoft Composer* and review the *Components* tab.
. Click *Install* and then *Install Bundle*. The installation takes a few minutes.

After installing the bundle, generate credentials to configure the connection to Composer. Store the credentials securely since the credentials are visible only once for security purposes. If you need additional information, contact your NetSuite administrator.

To generate credentials in the form of tokens, follow these steps:

. Assign the newly created *MuleSoft Composer* role to the desired user:
.. Go to *Setup > Users/Roles > Manage Users*.
.. Click on the user who will host the integration. You can use a generic account such as `it@company.com` that doesn't need its own license.
. Create an integration:
.. Go to *Setup > Integration > Manage Integration > New*.
.. Enter a name and appropriate concurrency for the integration. You can start low and use 1-2 units lower than the maximum concurrency allowed.
.. Select the *Token-Based Authentication* box.
. Generate access tokens:
.. Go to *Setup > Users/Roles > User Management > Access Tokens*.
.. Set the application to the integration created in the previous step.
.. Assign the user and click *Save*.
. Identify the NetSuite account ID by going to *Setup > Company > Company Information*.

=== Run Server SuiteScript to Trigger Workflows

If your NetSuite configuration preferences are set to run server SuiteScript and trigger workflows, the following criteria are required:

* The *Audience* field must have all roles selected.
* The *Execute As Role* field must be set to `Administrator`.
* The *Log Level* field must be set to `Debug`.

+
image::images/get-records-netsuite.png[Query builder UI, 500]
+
* You can choose which fields the action fetches in the *Result fields* section.
* You can add one or more conditions to specify which types of records should be returned in the *Criteria* section. For example, you could specify that the last name begin with "B."
* You can select *All records* in the *How Many Records to Retrieve* section to retrieve a list of records that match your criteria. The *All records* option is selected by default. If you want to access a single record from the list, you must add a xref:ms_composer_flows.adoc#create-and-test-a-for-each-loop[For Each loop] to your flow. 
* If you have filtered your search with a unique identifier, you can select *Only the first record* in the *How Many Records to Retrieve* section to return a single record. Returning a single record will change the output of the search from a _list_ to a _single_ record. The *Get records* action searches for all records and returns only the first record in the list. +
If you previously selected *All records* and then changed your selection to *Only the first record*, data pills in your existing flow could be invalidated.

====
The CURRENCY and PAYMENT_ITEM objects are not supported by the GET RECORDS action.

The LEAD and PROSPECT objects are supported only by the GET RECORDS action. The LEAD and PROSPECT objects are subtypes of the CUSTOMER object, so to use the LEAD and PROSPECT objects for other actions, you can set the object type to CUSTOMER and set the `internalId` of `entityStatus` to the corresponding value according to the NetSuite documentation.

The DEPARTMENT, LOCATION, PRICE_LEVEL, and SUBSIDIARY objects are supported only by the GET RECORDS action.
