= Build a Composer Flow

After you collect the information described in xref:ms_composer_checklist.adoc[the preparation checklist], you can then build, xref:ms_composer_activation.adoc[activate], and xref:ms_composer_monitoring.adoc[monitor] your flows. Building a flow involves creating a new flow or cloning an existing flow; adding and testing a trigger; adding and testing each action to be performed by the flow, in the order that you want each action performed; and finally testing the completed new flow before activating it.

xref:ms_composer_test_flow.adoc[Test] each trigger and action as you add it to your flow.

[[flow-details-page]]
== Flow Details Page 

Access the *Flow Details* page to see details about your flow:

. Click *Save*. +
The flow is imported. 
endif::[]

== Refresh a Flow

When building a flow, you may need to refresh the flow to view updated data at either the object level or the field level.

To refresh a object:

. Open the flow.
. Click the refresh icon in the upper right corner of the trigger or action card that you want to refresh.
+
image:images/composer_refresh_card.png[Refreshing an object]
The cache for the object type is cleared and the new data is retrieved.

To refresh a field:

. Open the flow.
. Click the refresh icon in the bottom left corner of the trigger or action card.
+
image:images/composer_refresh_field.png[Refreshing a field]
The cache for the field is cleared. The new value providers for the field are retrieved.

== Create a Flow Trigger

After you create or clone a flow, define the trigger: the event or time interval that starts the flow. A trigger step is required to test or activate your flow.

To define a trigger based on an event:

. Open a flow if it is not already open. The *What Should Start This Flow?* dialog is displayed.
+
image:images/connection-example.png[What Should Start This Flow dialog, 500]
. Select the connector where the triggering event occurs. Your existing connections are displayed.
+
image:images/list-of-connections.png[List of connections, 500]
+
You can choose an existing connection or create a new one:

* Click an existing connection to select it.
* Click *Add new _connector name_ Connection* to create a new connection and select it. +
You can rename or delete connections from this dialog by clicking the gear icon.

. After you choose a connection, the trigger step displays:
+
image:images/trigger-definition.png[Trigger step, 600]
+
Your trigger is named automatically. All triggers are named by combining the event or operation with the system name. For example, "On new record in Salesforce".

* Optionally, you can rename the trigger. Valid characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, hyphen ( - ), dot ( . ), and underscore ( _ ).

* Choose an event that starts the flow. Supply additional information as requested.

* Click *Save*.

[[change-a-connection]]
== Change a Connection

You can change connections in a trigger or action. For example, you can create a flow using connections to a Salesforce sandbox org, and then after your flow testing is complete, you can change the connection in your trigger and actions to use a production org.

You can only change to a connection accessing the same system type. You can't change a Workday connection to a Google Sheets connection, for example.

To change a connection:

. Open the flow.
. Click the change icon in the trigger or action that connects to a sandbox:
+
image::images/change-connection.png[Change the connection control, 400]

. Choose a new connection and click *Save*.

== Repair a Connection

If your OAuth connection is lost, you can repair the connection by refreshing the access token.

To repair a connection:

. Open the flow.
. Click *Edit*.
. Click the change icon in the trigger or action that requires repair, and then click *Change Connection*.
. Click *Repair*.

== Delete a Connection

If you no longer need a specific connection, you can delete it.

To delete a connection:

. <<create-a-new-flow,Create a new flow>> or add a step to an existing flow.
. If you create a new flow:
 .. Select the connector or system to start your flow.
 .. In the *What Should Start This Flow?* window, click the gear icon.
. If you add a step to an existing flow:
 .. Select the connector or system to start your flow.
 .. In the *Next Step* window, click the gear icon.
. In the *Manage <Connector Name> Connections* window, next to the connection that you want to delete, click the trashcan. +
A message appears ensuring that you want to delete the selected connection. A window appears, displaying a list of flows currently using that connection. If the connection is: +
* Not used in any flows, you can delete the connection.
* Used in inactive flows, a list containing the name and count of inactive flows using this connection appears. Deleting this connection will affect the listed flows. If you reopen the inactive flow, you must <<change-a-connection,select a new connection>>.
* Used in active and inactive flows, a list containing the name, count, and status of active and inactive flows using this connection appears. If you choose to delete the connection, secondary confirmation appears. Prior to deleting the connection, Composer will first attempt to stop the flows.
. Click *Delete*. +
The connection is deleted.

== Schedule a Flow

If you don't choose a connection, you can schedule a flow to start at regular intervals.

To create a flow control:

. In a new flow, from the *What Should Start This Flow?* dialog, look in the Flow Control section and click *Scheduler*.
+
image:images/connection-example.png[What Should Start This Flow dialog, 500]
. Choose one of the time intervals, from 15 minutes to 30 days.
+
image::images/connection-scheduler.png[New trigger with time interval, 500]
. Click *Save*. +
After creating the trigger, add one or more actions to the flow. To apply logic to an action, prepend it with an <<create-an-if-else-block,If/Else block>> or <<create-and-test-a-for-each-loop,For Each>> loop.

== Open Access for Flows

All users can view or manage all flows within your org.

This feature is enabled by default for new customers and disabled by default for existing customers. To disable this feature at the org level, contact Composer Support.

=== Limitations

* To filter by owner of the flow, you must use the *Flow Owner* field and not the *Owner* field.
* When filtering using the *Flow Owner* field, you can use only the *starts with*, *equals*, and *contains* operators. The *starts with*, *equals*, and *contains* operators all mimic the functionality of the *contains* operator.
* In orgs of existing customers, *Flow Owner* is not visible by default in the list view on the *Composer Flows* tab. New customers, however, can see *Flow Owner* by default in the list view on the *Composer Flows* tab.

** To add *Flow Owner* to the *Recently viewed* list:

. From the *Composer Flows* tab, select *Recently viewed*.
. Go to *Setup > Search Layouts > Composer Flow > Default Layout*.
. Add *Flow Owner*.

** To add *Flow Owner* to *All* (or any other view list):

. From the *Composer Flows* tab, select *All*.
. Go to *List View Controls > Select Fields to Display*.
. Move *Flow Owner* from *Available Fields* to *Visible Fields*.
+
* Bulk ownership transfer or changing ownership to a user other than yourself is not supported.

=== View Flows

You can view all flows within your org and view flow details, such as the status to see if a flow is active or inactive, the last modified date to see flow changes (not activation or deactivation), the flow owner, or the run history.

To view all flows within your org:

. Go to the *Composer Flows* tab. You can now view all flows within your org and view flow details, such as *Flow Name*, *Status*, and *Last Modified Date*.

=== Manage Flows

You can manage all flows within your org. You can activate or deactivate all flows within your org, delete all flows within your org, edit all flows within your org, or change ownership of error email notification flows within your org.

To manage all flows within your org:

. From the *Composer Flows* tab, select a flow.
. Click on the desired button, for example, click *Delete* to delete a flow or click *Transfer ownership* to change flow ownership (for error email notification flows only).

== Create an Action

To create an action:

. After the trigger in your flow, click the large plus sign to open the *Add Action* dialog.
. Click or create a connection for the action.
+
For example, if your trigger is "new records created in Salesforce," and you want your action to be "copy new record to a Google Sheet," then you would choose or create a Google Sheet connection.
. Select an action, and any other values displayed. What you have to specify for an action depends on system type you are connected to for the action.
. If you want to edit a field, and that field is enabled for a xref:ms_composer_custom_expression_editor.adoc#add-custom-expression-to-an-action[custom expression], click the pencil icon. +
Note that you can only enter text or select a single data pill for a field. If you want to enter a complex expression (including functions, math operators, concatenation of text, and special tokens), you must use the *Custom Expression Editor*.
. Click *Save*.

When there are null values in custom expressions and are:

* Fields without attributes, the null value is ignored. If the value in a required field, an error message occurs. If the value is in an optional field, the value is ignored and not sent to the connector. +
* Fields with attributes, the value is ignored and not sent to the connector.

=== Create a Picklist Mapping

Using Picklist Mapping, you can map data from one application to the corresponding data needed by another application and then reuse those mappings in different flows in your organization. This enables you to connect two applications that have different values for similar fields and to align the values in those fields across applications. You can then determine how the possible values of an output field (data pill) map to the possible values of an input field.

For example, you can map a data pill from the *Country* field in a Salesforce record and provide the same values in the *Country* field of the NetSuite record.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Country (Salesforce) | Country (NetSuite)
|US |_unitedStates
|CA |_canada
|DE |_germany
|AR |_argentina
|===

In this example, the *Status* field in a case in Salesforce is mapped to the *Status* field in a ticket in Zendesk to create continuity in field values across systems.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Status (Salesforce) | Status (Zendesk)
|New |New
|Working |Open
|Waiting on Customer |On-Hold
|Escalated |Open
|Closed |Closed
|===

When mapping source data fields:

* The source field must be a data pill with a fixed list of values.
* The target field must be an enumerated xref:ms_composer_custom_expression_editor.adoc#data-types[data type] field.
* If any other unmapped value from the source system is found, the default mapping specifies the value in the target system . If you do not specify a default value, the original value from the source field is passed to the target field.
* The mapping is stored at the organization level and can be reused across flows.
* The mapping must have a unique name.
* Mappings are available to everyone in your organization.

To map source data fields to target fields:

. From the *Composer Flows* tab, open a flow and click *Edit*.
. In an action card, in a field that supports *Pick from List*, select *Picklist Mapping* from the drop-down menu. +
The *Picklist Mapping* window appears.
. In the *Picklist Source* section, in the *Source* field, select the value from the drop-down list that you want to  map to the value in the *Target* field, and then click *Next*.
. In the *Global Picklist Selection* section, create a new picklist or choose an existing picklist.

=== Create a new picklist

To create a new picklist:

. Click *Create new picklist*.
. In the *Global picklist name* field, enter a unique name for the picklist.
. Optionally, in the *Description* field, enter a description for the picklist. The following description is populated automatically based on your source and target systems: +
`This maps [Source Field Name] from [Source Connection Name] to [Target Field Name] from [Target Connection Name]`
. In the table, select the source fields and their target mappings.
. Optionally, to add additional field mappings, click *Add Row* and enter the source field values manually (with a row representing each value) and select the target mappings from the drop-down.
. Once you have added all applicable field mappings, click *Create Picklist*.
. Click *Apply*. +
The *<Picklist Name>* section appears, displaying a table of values and their mappings.

=== Choose an existing picklist

To choose an existing picklist:

. Select a picklist from the list. Note that all edits made to an existing picklist will impact all flows in which that picklist is currently used.
. Optionally, in the *<Picklist Name>* section, to edit the values, click the pencil. Once you have edited the values, click *Save Picklist* and then click *Apply*.
. Optionally, in the *<Picklist Name>* section, to delete the picklist, click the trashcan. Note that deleting a global picklist will affect all flows currently using that picklist.
. Click *Apply*. +
The action card appears.

== Create a Flow Control

If you need to perform some logic before an action, select a flow control first:

. After the trigger in your flow, click the large plus sign to open the *Add Action* dialog.
. Click either *If/Else Block* or *For Each*. An If/Else block is good when you need to do different actions depending on one or more conditions. A For Each loop is good for processing a set of records.
. Complete the flow control, which usually includes adding an action.
. Click *Save*.

[[create-an-if-else-block]]
=== Add an If/Else Block

You can create an If/Else block to set conditions and execute actions only when specific criteria are met. This enables you to create flows that cover more than one linear branch, without the need to create separate flows.

Branches are logic-based steps that run vertically in a flow. You can add multiple steps inside each branch. Each branch is then executed in sequential order.

When adding decision steps, the values in the *Field* list are populated based on values selected when you designate the previous steps of your flow. After the *Field* value is selected, all compatible value options appear in the <<supported-operators,*Operator*>> list. If the selected *Operator* requires a second data pill to complete the condition, then the *Value* field is enabled and the list is populated based on the values you selected when defining the trigger. In the *Value* field, you can either enter a value manually or you can set it using the existing data from your flow.

For the purposes of comparing flows, if you initiate a date comparison when building a flow and there is no value in one of the date fields, the missing value is updated to `0001-01-01` by default.

The following operators are supported when building conditions in an If/Else block:

[[supported-operators]]
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Function | Supported Data Type | Value Required? | Notes
|Equals/Does not equal | All | Yes |The value in this field is case-sensitive for strings.
|Contains/Does not contain | Array, String | Yes | None
|Greater than/Less than |  Date, Number | Yes | In the *Date* field, the *Greater than* value is equal to a later date and the *Less than* value is equal to an earlier date.
|Greater than or equal/Less than or equal | Date, Number | Yes | In the *Date* field, the *Greater than or equal* value is equal to a later date or the current date and the *Less than or equal* value is equal to an earlier date or the current date.
|Is empty/Is not empty |Array, String, Object | No | None
|Starts with/Ends with | String | Yes | A string value for this field is required.
|Is true/Is false | Boolean | No | None
| Is present/Is not present | All | No | If the value in this field is null or if there is no value selected, then the value in this field is set to *Not present* by default.
|===

To create an If/Else block:

. Click the plus sign after the trigger or the last action in your flow.
. Click *Add Action*.
. Click *If/Else Block* to define the first branch.
. Enter the requested criteria. You can specify that `all conditions should be met (AND)`, `any condition can be met (OR)`, or <<use-custom-logic,customize>> the order and grouping of your conditions.
. Click *+* to add an action to that branch. Every branch must have an action, also called a _step_.
. If you want to add another branch, click *Add If* and repeat the previous steps for every If/Else branch you create.
. If you want to set criteria for how the flow executes if none of the criteria for the existing branches are met, click *Add Else* and repeat the previous steps for the final branch.
. If you want to add additional conditions to your If/Else block, click *Add condition*.
. After you add all the branches, click *Save*.

[[use-custom-logic]]
== Use Custom Logic

Custom logic uses the row number for each condition in the If statement block of an If/Else statement and `OR`, `AND`, and `NOT` to create complex expressions.  When you select the custom logic option, each condition is assigned a number and you can then use that number to customize the order of operations for the conditions.

When using custom logic, all conditions defined must be referenced in the expression for the expression to be validated. For example, if there are three defined conditions and you enter “1 and (2 or 1)”, the expression is invalid because “3” is not referenced.

 Using custom logic, you can have up to 20 conditions and a condition can be referenced more than once.

[[create-and-test-a-for-each-loop]]
== Create a For Each Loop

To create a For Each Loop:

. Click the plus sign after the trigger or the last action in your flow.
. Click *Add Action*.
. Click *For Each*.
. Choose a data pill from the *Input list*. You must have a trigger or action that returns a set of records or there won't be anything to choose here.
. Click the plus sign to add an action.
. After you complete the action, click *Save*.

You can add logic and actions in different patterns, depending on what your flow needs to do.

== Designate Error Handling 

When executing a flow, you can configure additional actions or steps to occur in the event of an error. 

[[access-error-handling]]
=== Access Error Handling 

Review your flow and determine to which steps you want to add an Error Handler. These steps could be steps in which, when they fail,  you want additional actions to occur or to send notifications. 

To designate how Composer handles errors encountered in your flow:

. <<create-a-new-flow,Create a new flow>> or open an existing flow.
. If you create a new flow:
.. Select the connector or system to start your flow.
.. Select and configure a trigger. 
.. Select and configure an action.
.. Directly before the step to which you want to add an Error Handler, click the plus button. 
.. In the *What Should Start This Flow?* window, click *Error Handler (Beta)*.
. If you add a step to an existing flow:
.. Open your flow.
.. Directly before the step to which you want to add an Error Handler, click the plus button. 
.. In the *Next Step* window, click *Error Handler (Beta)*. +

You can now watch a step or configure Composer to handle errors. 

[[watch-a-step]]
=== Watch a Step 

You can watch specific steps for errors in connection or logic. If an error occurs, the flow stops processing steps in this section. You can add one or more steps in  this section.

To watch a step: 

. <<access-error-handling,Access the Error Handler in your flow>>.
.  In the *Error Handler* card, in the *Watch* section, click the plus sign and select the action in your flow that you want to watch or drag the step that you want to watch into the *Watch* section. +
The selected action appears in the *Watch* section. If an error occurs, the flow moves to the actions selected in the *On Error* section.
. To add additional actions to watch, repeat the previous step.


=== Configure Composer to Handle Errors 

You can configure Composer to handle errors encountered in the *Watch* section. If an error occurs in a watched action, the *On Error* begins processing the flow based on your configuration.  You can add one or more steps to run in the *On Error* section. 

To add steps to the *On Error* section of your flow: 

==== Before You Begin 

* By default, the *On Error* section allows for one condition to be met; however, you can add as many conditions as you want in this section. 
* When adding a new condition, the *On Error* condition field value is set to `None` by default.  Leaving this value set to `None` processes any errors that may occur in the *Watch* section and processes all steps inside this *On Error* section. 
* When a condition is met in the *On Error* section, the Error Handler processes the conditions in sequential order and fulfills the first condition met. After the first condition is met, any subsequent steps are skipped. If you want the process to continue, you can add an additional *On Error* section inside your existing *On Error* section (i.e., nest) and set the condition to run. 
* When xref:ms_composer_test_flow.adoc[testing your flow], any errors caught by the Error Handler appear in the right pane of the action card. Successful steps are marked with a green check and failed steps will be marked with a red x. 
* When an error occurs in a watched action, the error information is saved as a data pill that can then be used for subsequent notification or record-updating actions. For example, if an error occurs, the error information is saved as a data pill. You can then create an action to send an email to your team containing error information for anything that fails in the Error Handler.

==== Steps 

. <<watch-a-step,Select a step to watch>>.
. In the *Error Handler* card, in the *On Error* section: 
.. In the *Conditions to run this branch* drop-down, select one of the following conditions and then enter the requested criteria: 
... `AND`: All conditions must be met.
... `OR`: Any conditions can be met.
... `None`: No conditions must be met and all errors are returned.
... `Custom Logic`: <<use-custom-logic,Customize logic>> to designate how conditions will be met. 
.. In the *After Running* drop-down, select: 
... *Stop*: After processing all steps in the *On Error* section, errors are flagged and the flow stops. the *Status* field of the flow is marked as `FAILED` on the <<flow-history-page,*Run History*>> page.  
... *Continue*: After processing all steps in the *On Error* section, errors are dismissed and the flow continues. If no other errors occur, the *Status* field of the flow is marked as `SUCCESS` on the <<flow-history-page,*Run History*>> page.  
. If you want to add additional conditions to this *On Error* section, click *Add Condition*. 
. If you want to look for a specific error condition and designate how it is handled within your existing *On Error* section, click *Add On Error* to add a new branch with steps. When adding a branch to the *On Error* section, in the *After Running* section, select: 
.. *Continue*:  Processes *On Error* steps and then continues on the next step within the parent step, 
.. *Propagate*:  Processes *On Error* steps and then pushes the error to the parent Error Handler section. The child step then stops processing and returns to the parent step. 
. Optionally, in the *On Error* section, click the plus button to add additional steps to handle an error: 
.. In the *Next Step* window, select *System Action*. 
.. Select an action to be completed when an error occurs. For example, you can add an action that will send a notification email with the Record ID and error information to your team or you can update the source record with error information. 
.. Configure the action. 
. Save the flow.
