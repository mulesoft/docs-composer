= Release Notes for MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce - 2022

Use MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce to build connected experiences faster. You don't need to wait for development resources to unlock data, integrate apps, and automate business processes that create real customer value.

New versions are automatically available once they are released; you don't need to perform any tasks to move to the new version.

//* Fixed the issue in Workday Connector in which the the *Create Worker* action returned a value for *Applicant Reference ID* but not for *Employee Reference*.
//| Fixed an issue in NetSuite Connector in which creating custom fields on the *Contact* object with the type `document` did not return results. | COCN-752
//| Fixed an issue in NetSuite Connector in which nested fields containing the `list` type failed. | COCN-726
//* Composer now supports the static creation of lists. You can now dynamically complete fields that are enabled for lists even if those fields do not have an existing list to map to in the flow.

* You can now create new flows from templates. This release includes support for the following templates:
** Create Or Update Jira Issue for Associated Change Request in Salesforce
** Create Or Update Jira Issue for Associated Work Plan in Salesforce
** Create Or Update Jira Issue for Associated Work Step in Salesforce
** Create Change Request in Salesforce for Associated Jira Issue
** Update Change Request in Salesforce for Associated Jira Issue
** Create Work Plan in Salesforce for Associated Jira Issue
** Update Work Plan in Salesforce for Associated Jira Issue
** Create Work Step in Salesforce for Associated Jira Issue
** Update Work Step in Salesforce for Associated Jira Issue
** Create or Update Incident and Asset for Associated ServiceNow Incident
** Create or Update ServiceNow Incident for Associated Incident in Salesforce
** Create Configuration Item for Associated Incident Asset in Salesforce
** Create or Update Netsuite Credit Memo for Associated Posted Credit Memo in Salesforce
** Create or Update Netsuite Customer for Associated Account in Salesforce
** Create or Update Netsuite Customer Payment for Associated Processed Payment in Salesforce
** Create or Update NetSuite Inventory Item for Associated Active Product in Salesforce
** Create or Update Netsuite Invoice for Associated Posted Invoice in Salesforce
** Create or Update Netsuite Sales Order for Associated Activated Order in Salesforce

+
Templates are patterns that you can leverage to build a flow. All of the steps and field mappings are predefined, so you can select the template and enter the missing information for the various connectors used (such as connection secrets) to create a flow you can later customize. Since templates are pre-built flows, templates not only reduce the barrier to entry and accelerate the time to activate the flow, but also include the best practices for flows.

* You can now transfer binary files as field inputs using data pills from within your Composer flow. For example, when keeping files in sync between Salesforce instances, you can download binary file content from one instance and later upload that same file content to another instance using the new *Download file* and *Upload file* actions.

* In RPA Connector, when you select the *RPA Process* dropdown, the values that appear are now listed in the following format: *<category> / <process name>*. For example, *Claims / Check for updates*.

* Picklist Mapping is now enabled for fields in an action that supports Pick from List. Using Picklist Mapping, you can map data from one application with the corresponding data needed by another application. This allows you to connect two applications that have different values for a similar field and to align the values in those fields across applications. You can determine how the possible values of an output field (data pill) map to the possible values of an input field. You can reuse the mapping across flows.

 ** When a field is selected or deselected and it has required parent fields, those parent fields are also selected or deselected by default.
 ** When an optional field is selected, the corresponding required fields (including one or more parent fields) are also selected.
