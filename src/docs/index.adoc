= MuleSoft Composer

When you connect data between apps and services, you build a real-time, integrated view of your customers and your business.
MuleSoft Composer (Composer) helps you build those connections with clicks instead of code from within your Salesforce org.

MuleSoft Composer is available from within your Salesforce org, and you can connect it to several data sources, including:

* Another Salesforce org
* A Tableau server
* A Google sheet
* A NetSuite account
* A Workday account

To create a functioning, real-time integration, you simply define a connection, define the actions you want to
be done and under what circumstances you want them done, then test, and finally activate the integration.

All the steps and definitions related to one integration are contained in a flow:

* One or more connections, which can be used by any flow, once defined
* A trigger--the condition or event that triggers your flow to start working on data
* The data to be retrieved
* The conditions you apply to each piece of data to determine whether or not to take action
* The action you wish to take if the conditions are satisfied

You can do something as simple as "copy the name field from each new User record to my ???" or as complicated
as ???
