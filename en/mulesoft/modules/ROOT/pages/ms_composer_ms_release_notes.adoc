= MuleSoft Composer Release Notes
:page-revdate: January 9, 2024

Use MuleSoft Composer to build connected experiences faster. You don't need to wait for development resources to unlock data, integrate apps, and automate business processes that create real customer value.

New versions are automatically available once they are released; you don't need to perform any tasks to move to the new version.

See xref:ms_composer_ms_release_notes_ki.adoc[Known Issues and Limitations for MuleSoft Composer] for a list of known issues and limitations by date.

You can determine how the possible values of an output field (data pill) map to the possible values of an input field. You can reuse the mapping across flows.

* You can now specify output fields in your invocable Composer flow so that these output fields are returned in the response payload to the system that triggers the invocable Composer flow.

+
Templates are patterns that you can leverage to build a flow. All of the steps and field mappings are predefined, so you can select the template and enter the missing information for the various connectors used (such as connection secrets) to create a flow you can later customize. Since templates are pre-built flows, templates not only reduce the barrier to entry and accelerate the time to activate the flow, but also include the best practices for flows.

* MuleSoft Anypoint Platform customers can now share externally available APIs managed in Anypoint Platform with business users for consumption in a MuleSoft Composer flow. This enhancement creates integrations that span beyond out-of-the-box connectors.

* To facilitate MuleSoft Automation, the subscription pricing method has been reevaluated for MuleSoft Composer. To enable this enhancement, a new menu, *Usage Summary*, has been added to the navigation pane. On the *Usage Summary* page, you can view your monthly tasks and credit usage per flow for your organization.
