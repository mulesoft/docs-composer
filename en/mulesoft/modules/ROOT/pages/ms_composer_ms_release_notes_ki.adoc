|Known Issue |Workaround |ID

|Composer's functionality may be subject to various limitations related to the external systems and their respective limits used in data retrieval. Composer is primarily intended for processing simpler and more lightweight datasets. It is important to understand that there is no single, rigid limit and that specific thresholds vary depending on each individual use case. For example, the following limits apply to https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_gov_limits.htm[Salesforce Connector].
|For use cases requiring greater control, advanced logic, or larger datasets, users should consider https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-code-builder/[Anypoint Code Builder].

|Known Issue |Workaround |ID

|When testing an Invocable Flow, if the value in the output fields was generated by a custom expression or if the value is either a `List<Object>` or a `List<Primitive>` data type, then the flow's final output step does not display the test output data. Output fields that refer to data pills or variables display test output as expected.
