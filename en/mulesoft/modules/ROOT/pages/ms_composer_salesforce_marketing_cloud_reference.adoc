= Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector Reference

Salesforce Marketing Cloud is a marketing platform that supports capabilities such as real-time customer engagement, email and marketing automation, social media engagement, mobile (SMS) messaging and push notifications, and customer marketing analytics.

To use the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector, you must first create an API Integration package and set permissions for email and SMS communication.

== Connections

To connect to a system, whether it is a source of data or the target where you are sending data, you must create a connection with that system's required credentials. You typically connect to different systems within a flow and can reuse each connection every time you need to connect.

For more information on how to create an API integration in Installed Packages, refer to https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/integration-s2s-client-credentials.html[Server-to-Server Integrations with Client Credentials Grant Type].

This system requires the following credential information for its connections:

Connection Display Name::

Enter a connection name that will help you remember the details of this connection.
You can reuse connections multiple times in a single flow, and in more than one flow,
and the credentials are hidden after you create the connection. Therefore, it's helpful
to provide a name that easily identifies this connection from others.
+
Only you can see the connection. Other users in your Composer app must create their own connections.

Client ID::

Enter the Client ID from the Installed Package.

Client Secret::

Enter the Client Secret from the Installed Package.

Authentication URI::

Enter the Authentication Base URI from the Installed Package.

Scopes::

(Optional) Enter the scopes MuleSoft Composer should have access to. This is helpful if your package has access to a larger number of scopes than are needed here.
Minimum scope required: offline, email_send, sms_send, list_and_subscribers_read

== Actions
