= MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce

You need to make timely business decisions using the most up-to-date data.

However, the data you need is often locked up in different systems.
Integrating these systems and data is a time-consuming, manual process,
and one that has to be repeated each time your organization adds a new system.
Many organizations need IT or line-of-business development teams to integrate systems and data and to automate the whole process.
This dependency puts a strain on IT organizations and development teams already stressed
by growing business demands and shrinking IT resources.

MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce (Composer) solves this problem. Composer makes it easy to build process automation for
data with clicks instead of code from within your Salesforce org.
When you create a process to connect information stored in different systems, you build a real-time,
integrated view of your customers and your business.

When you use Composer, you build a process called a flow that selects data from a system
such as Google Sheets, NetSuite, Tableau, Workday, or another Salesforce org.
Then, the flow performs tasks on that data and delivers it to a system.
You choose when to trigger the flow: when something happens, like a change to a record or row, or at intervals of time that you specify.

== Example

Imagine that a regional Slack user-group tracks its local members in a spreadsheet. The national organization
uses Salesforce to track membership. With Composer, the national team can write membership updates directly to the regional Google Sheets spreadsheet with Composer.

== Steps To Create a Flow

To create a functioning, real-time integration in Composer, you don't need coding experience.
Simply open Composer in your Salesforce org and create a flow that contains all the steps you need to get data from point A to point B:

Step 1: Choose or create a connection::

A connection is the username and password you'll use to access the data you want to work with, plus the URL where you
typically enter those credentials. Some systems require a few additional pieces of information, such as a security token.

After you define the connection, you can use it multiple times in the same flow or in different flows that you create.
Composer never exposes your credentials, and the connections are available only to you, even if other people are also building flows.

Step 2: Choose a trigger::

Every flow stars with a trigger: an event such as "a record or row is created," or a time interval to automatically launched the flow.
For example, whenever a user record is created or updated in Salesforce, the flow runs on that record.
If the trigger is defined as a time interval such as "run every 24 hours", no triggering event is defined and no connection is needed because the time interval is the trigger.

Connections are created or chosen while you are creating the trigger, as is the time interval.

Step 3: Define the actions you want to take::

Define what happens to the data fetched by the trigger, and when those actions should be taken.
For example, perhaps you want to fetch all the records that have changed
since a particular time--but copy over only the ones that have changed, or only the ones that are new.
Also, perhaps you want to copy over only some information from each record.

You can make the flow as elaborate or as simple as you need.

Step 4: Test your flow on one record::

While you are defining the flow, you see sample data that helps you know you are building the right steps.
After you are done building, you can test the flow on a single record in your sandbox org to ensure it behaves as you expect.
Nothing else changes until you click the activate button.

Step 5: Activate the flow::

After testing, activate the flow in your production org.
After being activated, the flow automatically runs when the conditions in the trigger are met.

Step 6: Monitor the behavior of your flow::

Use Composer tools to monitor your flow.

Mapping data between systems and doing exactly the right thing at the right time sometimes feels complicated;
however, using Composer helps you break down the logic into the steps required.
You can experiment with a flow until you've got it working just right,
and you can add complexity to it as you discover new use cases.
