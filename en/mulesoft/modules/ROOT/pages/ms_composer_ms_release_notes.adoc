* Picklist Mapping is now enabled for fields in an action that supports Pick from List. Using Picklist Mapping, you can map data from one application with the corresponding data needed by another application. This allows you to connect two applications that have different values for a similar field and to align the values in those fields across applications. You can determine how the possible values of an output field (data pill) map to the possible values of an input field. You can reuse the mapping across flows.
